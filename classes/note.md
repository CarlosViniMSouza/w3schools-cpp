## What is OOP?

**OOP** stands for **Object-Oriented Programming**.

**Procedural Programming** is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

1. OOP is faster and easier to execute

2. OOP provides a clear structure for the programs

3. OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug

4. OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time.

```
Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.
```

## What are Classes and Objects?

Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.

Difference between class and objects (Examples):

1 - `Class -> Car | Objects -> Chevrolet, Toyota, FIAT, etc ...`

2 - `Class -> Fruits | Objects -> Apple, Banana, Orange, etc ...`
