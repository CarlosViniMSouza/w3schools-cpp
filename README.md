## **Tutorial C++ by W3Schools**

*Objective*: create a knowledge base for study [Carbon Lang](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang) (still in experimental phase)

### **Intro**

### What is C++?

1 - C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

2 - C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

3 - C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.

### Why Use C++

1 - C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

2 - C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.

3 - C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

4 - C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

5 - "C++ is fun and easy to learn!" ðŸ‘‡

```
__         __
  \ (o_o) /  ~ "I don't believe that!"
```

6 - As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.

### Difference between C and C++

1 - C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.

3 - The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.

### **Examples in Each Chapter**

Our "Try it Yourself" editor makes it easy to learn C++. You can edit C++ code and view the result in your browser.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
```
